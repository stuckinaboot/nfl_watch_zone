FINAL PROJECT IDEA
--------------------
1) User logs in with their fantasy team (probably fantasy football)
2) Entire project is on a single page
3) Lists every player, with their most recent stats right next to their name, and next to that is a news ticker with headlines of their most recent news

NOTES
--------------------
-Look into using a template for display everything nicely
-Use the JQuery ticker I bookmarked for the news ticker
-Look into what yahoo-fantasy api gives access to
